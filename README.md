A Deep Learning project capable of recognizing real-world handwritten Kannada numerals (0-9) in real-time. This project uses a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a manually collected dataset and includes a live webcam interface for instant inference.



## Key Features

* **Real-Time Detection:** Live webcam integration using OpenCV to detect and classify digits on the fly.
* **Smart Preprocessing:** Implements dynamic thresholding to clean noisy webcam feeds and handle varying lighting conditions.
* **Robust Data Augmentation:** Uses rotation, zoom, and shift augmentation to improve model generalization on small datasets.

##  Challenges & Solutions (The Dev Journey)

Building this project involved overcoming several significant technical hurdles. Here is how they were solved:

### 1: Overfitting (High Variance)
* **The Issue:** The model initially achieved ~99% training accuracy but only ~75% validation accuracy. The Loss graph showed a distinct "U-turn," indicating the model was memorizing the training data instead of learning features.
* **The Diagnosis:** The model was too complex for the dataset size, and lacked regularization.

### 2: Underfitting (High Bias)
* **The Attempt:** We introduced heavy `Dropout(0.5)` layers and reduced the number of filters significantly.
* **The Result:** Both training and validation accuracy stalled at around 60%. The model became "too dumb" to learn the complex curves of Kannada digits.

### 3: The "Goldilocks" Balance (Final Model)
* **The Solution:** 1. Tuned Dropout rates to **0.2** (gentle regularization).
    2. Implemented **EarlyStopping** to prevent over-training.
    3. Fixed a critical **Double-Normalization bug** in the preprocessing pipeline that was feeding black images to the model.
* **Result:** Achieved a stable **88% Accuracy** with converging Loss curves.
  
### 4. The "Double Normalization" Bug
* **Problem:** During testing, the model predicted the same number (e.g., "2") for every single image with low confidence.
* **Root Cause:** The images were being divided by `255.0` in the preprocessing script, but the model already included a `Rescaling` layer. This turned all inputs into pitch-black images.
* **Solution:** Removed the external normalization step, allowing the model layer to handle the scaling internally.

### 5. DLL Load Failed (Version Conflicts)
* **Problem:** We encountered persistent `ImportError: DLL load failed` messages when importing OpenCV and NumPy.
* **Root Cause:** A version mismatch between the latest NumPy (2.0+) and the standard OpenCV binary wheels on Windows.
* **Solution:** Performed a clean wipe of the environment and pinned **NumPy to 1.26.4** and **OpenCV to <4.10**.

### 6. Webcam "Mode Collapse"
* **Problem:** The live webcam feed had low confidence (~60%) and struggled with shadows.
* **Solution:** Implemented **Binary Thresholding** (`cv2.threshold`) in the OpenCV loop. This forces the image to be strictly Black & White before the model sees it, removing background noise and boosting confidence to **99%**.



##  Dataset
The dataset consists of real-world images of Kannada digits collected manually.
